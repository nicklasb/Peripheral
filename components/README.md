# Components

Here, sub repos for lvgl and lvgl_esp32_driver should be cloned like this:  
lvgl/  
lvgl_esp32_drivers/


Remember to follow the instructions at the repo of the ESP32 port of lgvl:  
https://github.com/lvgl/lv_port_esp32 

The right versions are important, currently it won't work with 8.x. 
Or at least the demos doesn't..
